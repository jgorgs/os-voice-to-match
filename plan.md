#### Real-time Updates:
- [ ] Replace mock processing steps with real-time updates
- [ ] Handle `final_output` message to display job spec
- [ ] Remove thinking animation when final output received

### Phase 2: Audio Transcription Integration
**Dependencies:** Audio transcription service

#### Audio Workflow:
- [ ] Integrate speech-to-text service (e.g., OpenAI Whisper)
- [ ] Display transcribed text in chat
