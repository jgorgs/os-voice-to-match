## 🚧 **REMAINING PHASES TO IMPLEMENT**

### Phase 1: Supabase Backend Integration
**Dependencies:** Requires Supabase connection first

#### Database Tables Setup:
- [ ] `chat_history` table:
  - `id` (UUID, primary key)
  - `created_at` (timestamp)
  - `user_input_text` (text)
  - `agent_steps` (text array)
  - `final_job_spec` (text)
- [ ] `projects` table:
  - `id` (UUID, primary key) 
  - `created_at` (timestamp)
  - `job_spec_markdown` (text)

#### Storage Setup:
- [ ] Create `voice_notes` storage bucket
- [ ] Configure upload policies
- [ ] File upload integration

### Phase 2: Real-time Agent Communication
**Dependencies:** Supabase Realtime channels

#### Realtime Channel Setup:
- [ ] Configure `agent_progress` Supabase Realtime channel
- [ ] Listen for incoming messages
- [ ] Map agent messages to UI-friendly text:
  - `transcribe` → "✅ Transcribing audio..."
  - `generate_job_spec` → "🧠 Generating job spec..."
  - `tavily_search` → "🔍 Searching for supporting data..."

#### Real-time Updates:
- [ ] Replace mock processing steps with real-time updates
- [ ] Handle `final_output` message to display job spec
- [ ] Remove thinking animation when final output received

### Phase 3: Audio Processing Integration
**Dependencies:** Audio transcription service

#### Audio Workflow:
- [ ] Upload audio files to `voice_notes` bucket
- [ ] Trigger transcription service
- [ ] Display transcribed text in chat
- [ ] Integration with agent processing pipeline

### Phase 4: File Processing
**Dependencies:** File parsing capabilities

#### File Upload Workflow:
- [ ] Support for PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT files
- [ ] File content extraction
- [ ] Integration with agent processing for file analysis
- [ ] Display file analysis in chat history

### Phase 5: Data Persistence
**Dependencies:** Supabase database integration

#### Chat History:
- [ ] Save chat interactions to database
- [ ] Load previous chat sessions
- [ ] Export job specifications

#### Project Management:
- [ ] Save generated job specs to projects table
- [ ] Project listing/management interface
- [ ] Job spec versioning

## 📋 **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

1. **Connect Supabase** - User must connect Supabase integration first
2. **Create Database Schema** - Set up the required tables and storage
3. **Implement Realtime Channels** - Replace mock processing with real agent communication
4. **Audio Transcription** - Integrate speech-to-text service
5. **File Processing** - Add document parsing capabilities
6. **Data Persistence** - Save and load chat history and projects

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL NOTES**

### Current Mock Implementation:
- Simulated processing steps with setTimeout
- Mock job specification generation
- Local state management only

### Production Requirements:
- Real agent backend with processing pipeline
- Audio transcription service (e.g., OpenAI Whisper)
- Document parsing service
- Supabase integration for all data operations

## 🎯 **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

The application will be complete when:
- [ ] Users can input via voice, text, or file upload
- [ ] Real-time agent processing is visible to users
- [ ] Professional job specifications are generated and displayed
- [ ] All interactions are persisted in database
- [ ] Audio files are transcribed accurately
- [ ] Document files are processed and analyzed

## 📝 **CHANGE LOG**
